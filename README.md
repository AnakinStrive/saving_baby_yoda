# savingbabyyoda
The council has given me the task of searching the galaxy to find this baby Yoda. I will do my duty but this is the job of a padawan not a Jedi Master like me.

e build a simple prediction model using the galaxies.csv and data set for predicting a ship's crew size. 
This project is organized as follows: 

- data preprocessing and variable selection;
galaxies.csv: dataset used for finding the coordinates of planet. 

a) 2D dataset 
b) Use KMeans
c) Plot the clusters
d) Find the coordinates of the planet where it is hidden

a) Find where baby yoda is in the secret planet 2D dataset
b) Use PCA (top 2 components) to project the Jedi Force
c) Use KMeans
d) 5D Dataset
e) Using classes

galaxies.csv: dataset used for model building.
