# savingbabyyoda
The council has given me the task of searching the galaxy to find this baby Yoda. I will do my duty but this is the job of a padawan not a Jedi Master like me.

We build a simple prediction model using the galaxies.csv and planet.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. 
This project is organized as follows: 

- data preprocessing and variable selection;
galaxies.csv: dataset used for finding the coordinates of planet. 

a) 2D dataset 
b) Use KMeans
c) Plot the clusters
d) Find the coordinates of the planet where it is hidden

- Find where baby yoda is in the secret planet using the planet.csv
a) Use PCA (top 2 components) to project the Jedi Force
b) Use KMeans
c) 5D Dataset
d) Using classes

galaxies.csv: dataset used for model building using K-means.
planet.csv: dataset used for model building using PCA and K-means.
