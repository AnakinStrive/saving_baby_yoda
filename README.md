# Saving Baby Yoda
The council has given me the task of searching the galaxy to find this baby Yoda. I will do my duty but this is the job of a padawan not a Jedi Master like me.

We build a simple prediction model using the galaxies.csv and planet.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. 
This project is organized as follows: 

**Data preprocessing and variable selection**;


*  Dataset 
*  Use KMeans
*  Plot the clusters
*  Find the coordinates of the planet where it is hidden

**Find where baby yoda is in the secret planet using the planet.csv**
* Use PCA (top 2 components) to project the Jedi Force
* Use KMeans
* 5D Dataset
* Using classes

galaxies.csv: dataset used for model building using K-means.


planet.csv: dataset used for model building using PCA and K-means.
